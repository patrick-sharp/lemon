# Lemon

A MacOS window manager.
I like amethyst, but I want more homerow shortcuts.

It's called lemon because I think it will be a piece of shit that breaks all the time.

I use swiftlint to enforce style conventions. I just use it vanilla before committing.

I use swift package manager to manage dependencies / build process.
I also have a run.sh shell script that can also be used to compile/run.
