What is codesign?


ANSWERS

How do I make it so that my app doesn't show up in the dock (i.e. just a menu bar widget)?
This assumes you have already made an appdelegate
  1. In xcode, click on the project root in the dropdown
     (you should see a new tab open in xcode that ends in .xcodeproj)
  2. Click on the icon with the project's name under the "TARGETS" section
     (There should also be another section called "PROJECT" above "TARGETS")
  3. Under the "Custom macOS Application Target Properties" dropdown,
     add a new item with the key "Application is agent (UIElement)".
  4. Make the type a Boolean and the value "YES"
  5. Build the project again and it should only appear in the status bar
